        I enjoy software architecture, engineering and development. It can be
        anything from designing systems, platforms, product features or to just
        write some useless code to throw away.

        Been programming in C, C++, C#, Java, Lua, Javascript, Typescript and
        more. As each language has its strenghts and weaknesses, the
        one-language-to-rule-them-all does not exist in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer to use programming languages that makes programming easy. That
        includes syntax, tooling, build-steps and an active community.

        The what, why and when are questions I ask myself when starting a new
        project:
        <ul>
          <li>What is the purpose of what I'm about to do?</li>
          <li>Why should I do it?</li>
          <li>When will it be done?</li>
        </ul>
        It helps me to identify a scope and how to manage my time on projects.
