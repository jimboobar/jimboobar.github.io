    <div>
      <p>
        I'm just a guy who enjoys software architecture, engineering and
        development.
      </p>

        I prefer programming languages that makes programming easy. That
        includes syntax, tooling, build-steps and preferably an active
        community.
      </p>

        The what, why and when are questions I often ask myself:
        <ul>
          <li>What is the purpose?</li>
          <li>Has someone done it?</li>
          <li>Why should I do it?</li>
          <li>When will I be done?</li>
        </ul>
        These bullets helps me to identify a scope and how to manage my time on
        projects.
      </p>
