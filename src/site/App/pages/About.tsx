      <p>
        I'm a person that enjoys tinkering with things related software
        architecture, engineering and development. It can be anything from
        designing systems, product features to just writing some dumb code that
        I'll throw away at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many programming languages has grown in popularity over the years just
        to fade after a few more. I've had my fair share of programming in C,
        C++, C#, Java, Lua, Javascript, Typescript and more. My opinion on
        programming languages have shifted over the years along with my opinion
        on what's useful and not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every programming language I've been using so far has its strenghts and
        weaknesses compared to others. And my goto-language today is Typescript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typescript on node is lightweight, fast-enough, well supported, has a
        strong community and allows a mix of functional-programming and
        object-oritentet-programming that fits me and my projects that I write
        on my spare time.
      </p>

        A script-language that allows you to write efficient code with as few
        lines-of-code and frameworks as possible may actually suprise you.
        Consider the following when you're writing a web-application:
        <ul>
          <li>What do your application need to do?</li>
          <li>How long should it take to develop?</li>
          <li>How much should it cost to maintain?</li>
          <li>How much CPU does it need?</li>
          <li>How much memory does it need when idle?</li>
          <li>How much memory does it need under heavy-load?</li>
          <li>How many I/O-operations can it handle before it crashes?</li>
          <li>How long does it take for it to start?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
